I worked as a Research intern in the GPIO Photonics group at Natioanl Taiwan University. The focus of my research was to develop a VTOL solar-powered drone.

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Problem :</b></span>
For remote area applications, the potentail of drone technology is fundamentally limited due to its limited battery life. At the same time, it is not possible to use a large battery pack with a drone due to weight limits.

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Solution :</b></span>
Solar technology in tandem with batteries has enormous potential for powering mobile devices. In this hybrid system, the use of solar is to keep on recharging the primary battery during day time.

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Contribution :</b></span>
During my internship, I primarily worked for studying methods that might help in reusing of GaAs substrate :

- Epitaxial Lift Off (ELO) : Worked on the state of the art ELO process. Performed ELO of the new solar cell samples in HF bath under different concentration and time parameters. 

- Measurements using Scanning Acoustic Microscope (SAM) : Measured and evaluated the newly processed samples using SAM to get the information about the etching behaviour of sacrificial layers in different conditions, find defects and the material quality of the layers.

- I worked on electrochemical deposition of Ni/Cu contacts on the very thin solar cell layer that is generated after ELO process. This contact deposition is done to make the Î¼m thin solar cell layer stable and use the contacts for further characterisation.

- Experimented with different potential options for temporary substrates of solar cells, instead of conventional Ni/Cu plating. I found electrically conductive CU tape as a better alternative to the exisitng Ni/Cu plating in terms of both time and cost of processing. I experimented by pasting the tape on the solar cell layer material and annealing this sample. The results were comparable to Ni/Cu plating method. With this cheaper substrate, it became possible to quickly evalute new solar cells with different layer composition.
