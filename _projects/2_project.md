Since very young age, I have been deeply fascinated by <a href="https://www.atlantiksolar.ethz.ch/index.html" target="_blank">AtlantikSolar</a>, a 5 meter wingspan Solar-Powered fixed-wing UAV that achieved 81 hr of continuous flight.

So during my undergad, I decided to pursue my dream project, to make a fixed-wing UAV that can fly perpetually, at the same time carry necessary payload to continuosly gather enviromental data. The aim was to make the system robust enough to address various environmental challenges our world faces : Wildlife Conservation, Poacher Monitoring, Pollution,Forest / Farm Fire. 

For all thesee remote area applications, the potential of Solar-Powered UAV is enormous. 

I divided my work into two parts : Solar-Powered UAV Development and Sensor Fusion Module Development.



<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Solar-Powered UAV Development :</b></span>

I designed and built a 3.1 meter wingspan UAV for this study. The UAV was built with balsa wood ribs, carbon fibre wing spars, and glass fibre to keep the overall design compact and light weight.

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>1.) Design Simulations :</b></span>

I first used XFLR5 to analyse the design parameters to provide optimum gliding ratio for the given design. A 3.1 meter wingspan UAV design with a dihedral angle of 3 degree and angle of attack of 4 degree was found to be the most appropriate.

The UAV flight Parameters Calculation were done keeping Level Flight condition in mind. During Level Flight :
- Thrust (T) = Drag Force (D) = ρCTDSV2 = 1.95N (the thrust produced by the propeller(T) compensates for the drag force(D))
- Lift Force Generated by wings (L) = Weight of UAV (mg) = ρCLSV2 (the lift force(L) generated by the wing compensates for the weight of the UAV(W))
- The Power Required for Level Flight was calculated using : Preq = T*V = 15.6W
- The Power required for Hand Launch of UAV was calculated by keeping the thrust to weight ratio of the UAV greater than 0.6/1 = 190W 
- Gliding Ratio was calculated as : CL / CTD= 23


<span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>2.) Motor Simualtion :</b></span>

After doing motor simulations on eCalc software, it was found that EMAX MT-3515 brushless DC moto with 13 by 6 folding propellers and 40A ESC will be a suitable option considering thrust-weight ratio, power consumption, temperature as the factors.

<span style="font-size: 16px;"><b>4.) System Electric Design :</b></span>

I used a 4s 3300mAh Lipo battery pack to meet the thrust requirements of the motor. In the design, 38 solar cells were chosen, as they would fit easily on the wing and generate around 100W of power under ideal condition. So, with this design configuration, we can completely rely on solar power during level flight (Preq Level Flight = 15.6W) and at the same time access power generated by solar could be used to recharge the battery. I used extremely light weight and flexible Sunpower C-60 solar cells, which were generously provided as an in-kind support from Sunpower. All solar cells were connected in series and laminated on the wings, to bring them sufficient strength.

The Solar charge controller, I used TI-BQ24650 MPPT solar charger.

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Sensor Fusion Module Development :</b></span>

I focused on desiging and building a light weight and low-cost air quality sensor and camera data fusion module with edge (AI) processing capabilities on the raspberry pi.
This sensor fusion module was integrated on the UAV as the payload. The concept was, with solar power, UAV can fly perpetually at the same collect air quality data and capture images, with focus on addressing various environmental challenges our world faces.

This data fusion module consisted of low-cost OPC R1 sensor, Pixhawk Flight controller and Raspberry Pi with an image sensor.

- The OPC-R1 sent PM2.5 data to RaspberryPi using an SPI to USB converter. OPCR1 weighs about 30 grams and is very ideal for UAV applications.

- The RaspberryPi used Mavlink protocol to communicate with the Pixhawk flight controller using a UART connection. Pixhawk sent GPS data and other flight parameters to RaspberryPi.

Various flight tests of the UAV were successfully conducted at around 30 meters altitude, especially keeping in mind to improve the flight characteristics and make it capable to carry the payload of the data fusion module.

Note : This work happended during peak Covid wave in 2020, so I had to leave the testing in between due to lockdown. But this dream still remains, and I will again start work on this one day!
