I worked as a Researcher with <a href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/business-areas/photovoltaics/iii-v-and-concentrator-photovoltaics.html" target="_blank">Dr. Pawan Gupta</a> to evaluate the impact of Stubble Burning on PM-2.5 levels. 

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Problem :</b></span>
Farmers in the state of Punjab and Haryana burn the stubble and this bruning leads to high pollution levels from October to January season in Northern India. Currently only Satellite data is used to monitor these farm fires, but this Satellite data is collected only 2 times during the day, thus limiting its use.

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Solution :</b></span>
If authorities have more real-time data on Stubble bunring and its sites, they can take much more effective action to limit its spread and control it.

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Contribution :</b></span>

- During our study, for collecting the PM-2.5 data I integrated low-cost Purple air (Plantower PMS5003) and Alphasense OPC-R1 sensors on a Phantom 4 drone, and flew the drone over a farm fire site that was happening in Karnal district in Haryana, India.

- We observed significant change in PM-2.5 values before, during and after the fire, with a clear spike in PM-2.5 values observed during the fire. We also tried to compare our results from the sensor integrated on drone to the data taken by the Satellite at 1:30 pm.

- Similarly we also observed the impact of Farm fire on PM-2.5 values in rural areas by doing mobile sensing with car and clearly found spike in PM-2.5 values near fire sites. We also did mobile sensing in rural area with negligible farm fires, and interestingly found that rural areas where farm fires are very frequent, had significantly higher PM-2.5 concentrations, thus showing impact of farm fires in rural areas.
