I worked as a Researcher with <a href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/business-areas/photovoltaics/iii-v-and-concentrator-photovoltaics.html" target="_blank">Dr. Pawan Gupta</a> to evaluate the efficacy of low-cost air quality sensor as a mobile platform to collect PM-2.5 data in urban areas. 

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Problem :</b></span>
The highly accurate pollution monitoring sensors installed by CPCB in urban cities costs upard of Rs. 1 crore and are static in nature. So, it becomes tough to accurately detect the soruces of pollution in an urban areas.

<span style="font-size: 17px;"><b>Solution :</b></span>
By using cars as a mobile monitoring platform and integrating low-cost air quality sensors on it, it is possible to do spatio-tempotal sampling of PM-2.5 levels, to more accurately detect the sources of pollution in an urban area.

- For our study, we used Diwali festival as the occasion to collect data with our mobile moitoring platform. We were focused and collected data with our mobile platform, pre, during and post fire cracker burning activities during Diwali, to effectively monitor the variation and impact of fire crackers on the air quality of Jaipur city.

- For making the sensor fusion module, we used a Raspberry Pi that was acting as central unit. Both Purple air (Plantower PMS5003) and Alphasense OPC-R1 sensors were conncted to the Raspberry Pi and sending data at every 5 to 10 seconds interval. Similarly as GPS was storing location and date time on the Raspberry Pi. There was a script running that combing and mapping PM-2.5 data from the two sensor with datetime, location from GPS module. Later we plotted this data using matplotlib on a map of Jaipur city.

- The sensor module was housed inside a plastic mechanical enclosure and the PM-2.5 sensors were exposed to the air.

- After collecting the data for a week period, we observed significantly lower PM2.5 in Jaipur during 2020 Diwali compared to previous years due to favourable weather conditions and firecracker ban.

- With mobile air quality monitoring, location of a pollution hotspot was also identified in Jaipur city.

- We also studied long-term (2000â€“2020) aerosol optical depth of Jaipur city and Observed a 29% increase in aerosol optical depth of Jaipur, but it was found to be significantly
lower than Delhi.

- We also obsered an increase in aerosol optical depth and PM2.5 due to crop residue burning during Diwali week in Jaipur.
